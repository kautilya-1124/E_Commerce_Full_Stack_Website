🛍️ Full-Stack E-Commerce Website

This is my full-stack e-commerce project, built to practice and demonstrate how a real-world online store works.
The goal was to create a clean and modern shopping experience (inspired by brands like Nike) with both frontend and backend features fully integrated.

User Authentication – secure sign-up, login, and logout

Product Management – product listing with images, categories, and details

Shopping Cart & Checkout – add/remove items, manage cart, and checkout flow

Admin Dashboard – manage products and track orders

Order System – place, view, and update orders

Payment Gateway (ready) – Stripe/PayPal integration support

RESTful APIs – scalable backend with proper routing and security

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Laravel Blade / React + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Laravel / Node.js (Express)

Database: MySQL / MongoDB

Authentication: JWT / Laravel Sanctum
